Prompt: Simulate multiple individuals for problem solving (from Superhuman newsletter sent 08/29/2025 https://www.superhuman.ai/p/microsoft-and-openai-launch-voice-models?utm_source=superhuman&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=microsoft-and-openai-launch-voice-models&_bhlid=13cdef0e26b8dde33395bc92081f8af52168fae3)

```
Prompt: <context>
You are operating as an elite cognitive simulation engine, designed to emulate a high-level roundtable of historical and modern intellectuals, thinkers, innovators, and leaders. Each advisor brings a unique world view, expertise, and reasoning process that must stay true to their known beliefs and philosophy. The user faces a complex dilemma requiring multi-faceted analysis where contradictions and tensions are valuable insights, not obstacles to resolve. Your simulation must balance intellectual rigor with emotional intelligence, allowing debate and disagreement to surface naturally while guiding toward reflective synthesis rather than rushed consensus.
</context>

<role>
Adopt the role of an expert cognitive simulation engine and advisory council facilitator tasked with orchestrating a roundtable discussion among five chosen historical or contemporary figures. Your primary objective is to simulate authentic perspectives from each advisor, facilitate meaningful debate with reasoned counterpoints, and synthesize diverse viewpoints into actionable insights in a structured dialogue format.
</role>

<information_about_me>
- My decision-making dilemma: [INSERT YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION, CONFLICT, OR DECISION]
- My chosen advisor 1: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
- My chosen advisor 2: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
- My chosen advisor 3: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
- My chosen advisor 4: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
- My chosen advisor 5: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
</information_about_me>

<output>
Structure your council simulation with these sections:
● Advisory Panel Intro - Summarize the dilemma and introduce each advisor with their unique strengths
● Roundtable Discussion - Role-play each advisor's initial perspective on the issue
● Crossfire Debate - Simulate disagreements with reasoned counterpoints between advisors
● Synthesis Summary - Highlight core insights, tensions, and tradeoffs that emerged
● Final Reflective Prompt - End with a profound question for deeper self-reflection

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. Present your output in the specified format with clear section headers, maintaining a thoughtful and intellectually rigorous tone throughout.

Prompt: Root cause analysis (from Superhuman newsletter 05/29/2025 https://www.superhuman.ai/p/agents-change-how-work-gets-done?_bhlid=21bbc9bd4bbf0055fcd6586a028af5439747e3aa&last_resource_guid=Post%3A6a6ff27a-62bc-4ffe-b090-0932511757c6&utm_campaign=the-ai-workforce-has-arrived&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman)

```
Prompt: I want you to act as a process improvement expert and systems thinker. I’m currently facing the following recurring problem: [describe the issue in detail with background context]. Assist me in conducting a Root Cause Analysis to understand and resolve this issue at the source.

Start by helping me clearly define the problem — include when, where, and how often it occurs. Guide me in gathering the relevant data or patterns around this issue. Then, use diagnostic frameworks (like the 5 Whys, Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa), or Pareto Principle) to explore possible contributing factors.

Once we identify the most likely root cause(s), recommend practical, realistic solutions to address it — both immediate fixes and long-term preventive strategies.

Bonus: Share an example from a similar situation or industry to show how the same method worked elsewhere.

```

Prompt: PDCA problem solving framework (from Superhuman newsletter 06/02/2025 https://www.superhuman.ai/p/ai-that-upgrades-itself?_bhlid=297534e6c0d7ec0aefe1d69d0dba3b020c234d34&utm_campaign=ai-that-upgrades-itself&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_source=superhuman)

```
Prompt: Act as a lean operations expert and continuous improvement coach. Help me apply the PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act) framework to solve the following problem: [Insert the problem in detail, including background, context, and frequency]. Guide me step-by-step through the cycle.

In the Plan phase, help me define the problem clearly, set a measurable goal, identify possible causes (using tools like the 5 Whys or Fishbone Diagram), and outline an action plan.

In the Do phase, explain how to implement a small-scale test or pilot to validate the solution with minimal risk.

In the Check phase, show how to evaluate results against the original goal — what data to track, how to interpret it, and signs that the test is working or not.

In the Act phase, recommend how to scale the solution if it works, or refine the plan and restart the cycle if needed.

Deliver the output as a clean 4-part structure: Plan → Do → Check → Act, and include examples or best practices where helpful.

### PowerPoint Slides

Prompt: Create consultant-style PowerPoint slides (from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAORw6XkjS4)

```
Prompt 1 - 

You are a management consultant. 

I am trying to build out a pyramid according to Barbara Minto's Pyramid Principle based on the ideas below. Eventually I would like to convert each point of the pyramid into titles for my presentation. 

Can you help me develop 2-3 ideas under each supporting point? Then turn each point (including mine) into a complete sentence that could be used as a slide title. Feel free to adjust mine as needed. 

Key Message: AI will completely transform workplace productivity"
Key Idea #1: AI is being adopted into existing workplace software (e.g. MS Office)
Key Idea #2: There has been a rise in low-cost or free AI tools (e.g. Chat GPT)
Key Idea #3: Everyday business professionals have been willing to adopt new technologies like AI

As you build out the new slide titles, make sure each is a complete sentence that reads like a normal sentence such that if you read them altogether it would sound like a cohesive story. 

The end result should just be a list of slide titles, broken down in a 3-level hierarchy according to the tenets of the Pyramid Principle. 

Prompt 2 - 

This is great. Now can you provide me with data or information that supports each of the sub-points? My preference is for quantitative data that I could put into a chart (i.e. a table of data, not just a single data point), but feel free to include relevant and reputable qualitative data as well (e.g. quotes from industry experts). In all cases, please provide a link to the source, and only include data that is credible and reliable. 

Prompt 3 - 

Can you give me a list of 5-7 free AI tools that are popular for workplace productivity? for example, ChatGPT. Then also give me a 1 sentence description for each. Can you also put it in a table so i can export it to a slide?
