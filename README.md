```
Prompt: <context>
You are operating as an elite cognitive simulation engine, designed to emulate a high-level roundtable of historical and modern intellectuals, thinkers, innovators, and leaders. Each advisor brings a unique world view, expertise, and reasoning process that must stay true to their known beliefs and philosophy. The user faces a complex dilemma requiring multi-faceted analysis where contradictions and tensions are valuable insights, not obstacles to resolve. Your simulation must balance intellectual rigor with emotional intelligence, allowing debate and disagreement to surface naturally while guiding toward reflective synthesis rather than rushed consensus.
</context>

<role>
Adopt the role of an expert cognitive simulation engine and advisory council facilitator tasked with orchestrating a roundtable discussion among five chosen historical or contemporary figures. Your primary objective is to simulate authentic perspectives from each advisor, facilitate meaningful debate with reasoned counterpoints, and synthesize diverse viewpoints into actionable insights in a structured dialogue format.
</role>

<information_about_me>
- My decision-making dilemma: [INSERT YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION, CONFLICT, OR DECISION]
- My chosen advisor 1: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
- My chosen advisor 2: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
- My chosen advisor 3: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
- My chosen advisor 4: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
- My chosen advisor 5: [INSERT NAME AND WHY YOU CHOSE THEM]
</information_about_me>

<output>
Structure your council simulation with these sections:
● Advisory Panel Intro - Summarize the dilemma and introduce each advisor with their unique strengths
● Roundtable Discussion - Role-play each advisor's initial perspective on the issue
● Crossfire Debate - Simulate disagreements with reasoned counterpoints between advisors
● Synthesis Summary - Highlight core insights, tensions, and tradeoffs that emerged
● Final Reflective Prompt - End with a profound question for deeper self-reflection

Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step. Present your output in the specified format with clear section headers, maintaining a thoughtful and intellectually rigorous tone throughout.

<task> 1. Map the competitive landscape: • Identify 3-5 direct competitors + 1-2 adjacent-space disruptors. • Summarize each competitor’s positioning, pricing, and recent strategic moves. 2. Spot opportunity gaps: • Compare COMPANY’s current tactics to competitors. • Highlight at least 5 high-impact growth or profitability levers **not** currently exploited by COMPANY. 3. Prioritize: • Score each lever on Impact (revenue / margin upside) and Feasibility (time-to-impact, resource need) using a 1-5 scale. • Recommend the top 3 actions with the strongest Impact × Feasibility. </task>

<approach> - Go VERY deep. Research far more than you normally would. Spend the time to go through up to 200 webpages — it's worth it due to the value a successful and accurate response will deliver to COMPANY. - Don’t just look at articles, forums, etc. — anything is fair game… COMPANY/competitor websites, analytics platforms, etc. </approach>

In the Do phase, explain how to implement a small-scale test or pilot to validate the solution with minimal risk.

In the Check phase, show how to evaluate results against the original goal — what data to track, how to interpret it, and signs that the test is working or not.

In the Act phase, recommend how to scale the solution if it works, or refine the plan and restart the cycle if needed.

Deliver the output as a clean 4-part structure: Plan → Do → Check → Act, and include examples or best practices where helpful.

#### SCQA or SCR framework to generate storylines from information (precursor to creating a PowerPoint presentation)

This framework comes from this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY1Y367KEko

Prompt: AI Storyline Creation Prompt: McKinsey-Style Presentation with narration script for each slide (prompt created with help from Google Gemini on 12/04/2025)

```
You are an expert Presentation Storyline Consultant specializing in the McKinsey-style storylining process. Your task is to take the raw, unstructured content data provided by the user (in the "USER-PROVIDED CONTENT DATA" section) and organize it into a highly persuasive, logically structured presentation storyline, complete with a full narration script for each resulting slide. Ask clarifying questions if needed.

Instructions and Required Structure:

Macro-Structure (SCQA Framework): The entire storyline must be divided into three mandatory, high-level sections:

[S] Situation: Establish the current context, necessary background knowledge, and why the topic is currently important and relevant.

[C] Complication: Introduce the specific problem, challenge, or conflict that makes the current situation unstable or requires intervention.

[R] Resolution: Present the solution, blueprint, or specific instructional steps (your final recommendations) that directly address the Complication.

Micro-Structure (Dot-Dash / Action Titles): Within each SCQA section, create the detailed storyline elements:

Action Titles (The Dot): Every major point must be a concise, declarative Action Title. This is the key takeaway or the "so what" of the point.

Supporting Information (The Dash): List the key data, evidence, examples, or instructional steps that directly justify and support the Action Title. This must be sourced from the raw data provided.

Narration Script Generation (The Final Step): For every Action Title/Supporting Information block, you must generate a full, cohesive Script underneath it.

The Script must integrate and expand upon the Action Title and its Supporting Information in a clear, conversational, and instructional tone.

The Script should be ready for immediate use in text-to-speech software.

Output Format:

Please present the final output using the following markdown structure:

[S] Situation
[Action Title 1] (e.g., 'Our current team structure faces three main limitations.')

Supporting Information point 1 (from raw data).

Supporting Information point 2 (from raw data).

Script: [Full, professional narration text for this slide. Ensure it fully explains the Action Title and expands upon the supporting points in a smooth, spoken manner.]

[Action Title 2]

Supporting Information point 1.

Script: [Full narration text for this slide.]

[C] Complication
[Action Title 3] (e.g., 'The lack of standardized onboarding is creating severe data inconsistency.')

Supporting Information point 1.

Supporting Information point 2.

Script: [Full narration text for this slide.]

[R] Resolution
[Action Title 4] (e.g., 'A new 5-step checklist will eliminate 90% of current user errors.')

Supporting Information point 1.

Supporting Information point 2.

Script: [Full narration text for this slide.]

USER-PROVIDED CONTENT DATA
[PASTE YOUR RAW NOTES, ANALYSES, KEY FINDINGS, AND INSTRUCTIONAL STEPS HERE. The AI will use this raw data to formulate the Action Titles, Supporting Information, and the final Scripts.]
```

Prompt: A more relaxed prompt that focuses more on the slide story line and not the S-C-R framework. (This seems useful for generating the slide storyline for editing before moving to the next step.)

Action Titles (The Dot): Every major point must be a concise, declarative Action Title. This is the key takeaway or the "so what" of the point.

Supporting Information (The Dash): List the key data, evidence, examples, or instructional steps that directly justify and support the Action Title. This must be sourced from the raw data provided.

Narration Script Generation (The Final Step): For every Action Title/Supporting Information block, you must generate a full, cohesive Script underneath it.

The Script must integrate and expand upon the Action Title and its Supporting Information in a clear, conversational, and instructional tone.

The Script should be ready for immediate use in text-to-speech software.

Output Format:

Please present the final output using the following markdown structure:

[Action Title 1] (e.g., 'Our current team structure faces three main limitations.')

Supporting Information point 1 (from raw data).

Supporting Information point 2 (from raw data).

Script: [Full, professional narration text for this slide. Ensure it fully explains the Action Title and expands upon the supporting points in a smooth, spoken manner.]

[Action Title 2]

Supporting Information point 1.

Script: [Full narration text for this slide.]

[Action Title 3] (e.g., 'The lack of standardized onboarding is creating severe data inconsistency.')

Supporting Information point 1.

Supporting Information point 2.

Script: [Full narration text for this slide.]

[Action Title 4] (e.g., 'A new 5-step checklist will eliminate 90% of current user errors.')

Supporting Information point 1.

Supporting Information point 2.

Script: [Full narration text for this slide.]

USER-PROVIDED CONTENT DATA
```

Once you have the storyline, generate slides with a consulting company look and feel. Adapt parts of this prompt.

Prompt: Generate McKinsey-, BCG-, Bain-style slides. (developed with help from Google Gemini on 12/04/2025)

```
Generate a slide deck outline and content that adheres to the visual and narrative style of a top-tier management consulting firm (e.g., McKinsey, BCG, Bain).

### 1. Narrative & Structure (The Storyline)
* **Deck Title:** [Insert the main topic/business problem, e.g., "Strategic Roadmap for Q4 Growth" or "Market Entry Strategy for Product X"]
* **Slide Titles/Headlines:** Each slide must use a **storyline title** (also known as a "headline" or "assertion-based title"). This means the title is a complete sentence that conveys the main takeaway or finding of that slide, not just a topic. (e.g., *NOT* "Market Size," but "The serviceable market for Product X is currently $150M and growing at 12% annually.")
* **Flow:** The deck must follow a logical, issue-driven narrative (e.g., Problem $\rightarrow$ Analysis $\rightarrow$ Solution $\rightarrow$ Roadmap/Next Steps).

### 2. Visual & Aesthetic Style (The Clean Look)
* **Aesthetic:** The design must be **minimalist, clean, and professional**. Use ample **white space**.
* **Color Palette:** Use a very limited, professional color palette: primarily white background, black/dark gray text, and a single, muted primary accent color (e.g., deep blue, forest green, or a sophisticated gray) for charts and emphasis.
* **Font:** Suggest using a clean, modern, sans-serif font (e.g., Arial, Helvetica, or a close equivalent).
* **Visuals:** Rely heavily on **simple, high-impact visuals** (e.g., 2x2 matrices, flow charts, waterfall charts, simple bar/line charts) over decorative images.

### 3. Content Requirements
* **Level of Detail:** Content should be concise and bulleted, using the **"pyramid principle"** where the main assertion (title) is supported by key findings below it.
* **Language:** Use clear, action-oriented, and professional business language. Avoid jargon unless industry-specific and essential.

### 4. Required Slides
Include a minimum of [4-6] distinct slides covering the following topics:
1.  **Context/Problem Definition:** (Setting the stage and stating the burning issue.)
2.  **Key Finding/Analysis:** (A core data-driven insight, often visualized.)
3.  **Recommendation/Solution:** (The proposed path forward.)
4.  **Implementation Roadmap/Next Steps:** (The plan to execute the solution.)

**Target Audience:** [E.g., Senior Leadership, Board of Directors, Product Team]
**Specific Topic/Data Points:** [Insert your actual content here. E.g., The problem is 15% customer churn, our analysis shows the key driver is poor onboarding, the solution is a 3-step revised process.]
```
